# Getting Started with Trip++

Trip++ is a smart trip planner that takes the stress out of your trip planning!

The final version of the project can be access through: https://trip-plus-plus-final.netlify.app/

## Setup
Once you have Trip++ locally, you need to install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). It gets installed together with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Once you have `npm`, you can run the following commands to install, build, and launch the Trip++ GUI project.

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install installs a package and any packages that it depends on. If there existing a package-lock file, then the installation of dependencies will be driven by that. 

### `npm start`
